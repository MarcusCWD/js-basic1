// 2. CRAPS
// Create a game of craps using the Math.random() function to generate random numbers.
// At the start of the game, the player starts with $100.
// Each round of the game, roll one dice (getting a number between 1 to 6) and display that the user.
// Then ask the user how much money to bet. After which, roll the second dice and add up the total of both dice.
// If the sum is 7, the player loses the amount he has bet. Otherwise, he earns an amount equal to the bet.
// Next, ask the player if they want to continue. If they decide to, repeat one more round. Otherwise, the game ends.
